### 2. Document Processing

- Automated document analysis using AWS Step Functions
- Intelligent extraction of relevant information from documents
- Page-by-page processing capabilities
- Error handling and status tracking

### 3. Review Workflow

- Create review jobs that evaluate documents against checklists
- AI-powered assessment with confidence scoring
- Support for manual overrides and user comments
- Source reference tracking for transparency
- Batch processing of multiple documents

### 4. User Interface

- Web-based interface for checklist and review management
- Document upload and preview capabilities
