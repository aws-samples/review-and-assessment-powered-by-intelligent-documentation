## Current Status

### System Health

- ✅ Local development environment functional
- ✅ Core features operational
- ⚠️ Performance needs optimization for scale
- ⚠️ Test coverage incomplete

### Known Issues

1. **Performance**: Large document sets (>100 pages) process slowly
2. **Error Messages**: Some errors are too technical for end users
3. **UI Feedback**: Long operations lack progress indicators
4. **Test Coverage**: Repository tests need expansion

### Recent Changes

- Database schema updated with error_detail fields
- Index optimization for query performance
- Repository pattern fully implemented
- Frontend component library established

## Evolution of Decisions

### Initial Approach → Current State

**Database Design**

- Started with simple flat structure
- Evolved to hierarchical with proper relationships
- Added indexes based on query patterns

**Error Handling**

- Basic try-catch initially
- Now comprehensive error tracking in DB
- Step Functions handle retries

**Frontend Architecture**

- Started with page-based structure
- Moved to feature-based organization
- Established core component library

**Testing Strategy**

- Initially focused on unit tests
- Added integration tests with real DB
- Moving towards comprehensive coverage

## Metrics and Milestones

### Completed Milestones

- ✅ MVP functionality complete
- ✅ Local development environment stable
- ✅ Core workflows implemented
- ✅ Basic UI functional

### Upcoming Milestones

- 🎯 80% test coverage (currently ~60%)
- 🎯 Sub-second response times for common operations
- 🎯 Production deployment ready
- 🎯 User documentation complete

### Performance Targets

- Document processing: <30s for 50-page document
- API response times: <200ms for read operations
- UI responsiveness: <100ms for user interactions
- Database queries: <50ms for complex queries

## Development Velocity

### Recent Sprint Progress

- Week 1: Database schema and repository layer
- Week 2: Use case implementation
- Week 3: API endpoints and handlers
- Week 4: Frontend features and UI

### Blockers Resolved

- Database connection issues in Lambda
- Step Function error handling
- Frontend routing complexity
- Type safety across layers

### Current Focus Areas

1. Completing test coverage
2. Performance optimization
3. Error handling improvements
4. Documentation updates

## Technical Debt Log

### High Priority

- Refactor error handling to be more consistent
- Optimize database queries with better indexing
- Improve TypeScript type definitions

### Medium Priority

- Consolidate duplicate code in repositories
- Enhance logging consistency
- Improve build process efficiency

### Low Priority

- Update deprecated dependencies
- Clean up unused imports
- Optimize Docker image sizes

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

- Layered architecture provides clear separation
- Repository pattern simplifies testing
- Feature-based frontend scales nicely
- TypeScript prevents many bugs

### What Didn't Work

- Initial flat database design didn't scale
- Mocking Prisma for tests was problematic
- Generic error messages confused users

### Best Practices Established

- Always use dependency injection
- Test with real database connections
- Document complex business logic
- Keep components focused and small
