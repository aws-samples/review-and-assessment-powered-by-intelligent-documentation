To view service quotas for Amazon Bedrock, do one of the following:\n\n- Follow the steps at [Viewing service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/gs-request-quota.html) and select **Amazon Bedrock** as the service.\n\n- Refer to the [Amazon Bedrock service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/bedrock.html#limits_bedrock) in the AWS General Reference.\n\n\nTo maintain the performance of the service and to ensure appropriate usage of Amazon Bedrock, the default quotas assigned to an account might be updated depending on regional factors, payment history, fraudulent usage, and/or approval of a quota increase request.\n\n## Request an increase for Amazon Bedrock quotas\n\nThe steps for requesting a quota increase for your account depend on the value in the **Adjustable** column in the quotas table in [Amazon Bedrock service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/bedrock.html#limits_bedrock):\n\n- If a quota is marked as **Yes**, you can adjust it by following the steps at [Requesting a Quota\\\\\nIncrease](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html) in the Service Quotas User Guide.\n\n- If a quota is marked as **No**, you can submit a request through the [limit increase form](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase) to be considered for an increase.\n\n- The **On-demand model invocation** quotas aren't adjustable through Service Quotas. Contact your AWS account manager to be considered for an increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n###### Note\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to overwhelming demand, priority will be given to customers who generate traffic that consumes their existing quota allocation. Your request might be denied if you don't meet this condition.\n\n\n[Document Conventions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/docconventions.html)\n\nTroubleshooting Amazon Bedrock API Error Codes\n\nDocument history\n\nDid this page help you? - Yes\n\nThanks for letting us know we're doing a good job!\n\nIf you've got a moment, please tell us what we did right so we can do more of it.\n\nDid this page help you? - No\n\nThanks for letting us know this page needs work.

Can I increase the number of retries or is this a hard limit?\nI'm only sending one message to it every few minutes.. surely there is something wrong? Or are the rate limits really set this low?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nFollowCommentShare\n\nTopics\n\n[Machine Learning & AI](https://repost.aws/topics/TAXwEBZll0TtWxbiOoSjJrfw/machine-learning-ai) [Generative AI on AWS](https://repost.aws/topics/TA0veCRV2rQAmHpkzbMFojUA/generative-ai-on-aws)\n\nTags\n\n[Amazon Bedrock](https://repost.aws/tags/TAQeKlaPaNRQ2tWB6P7KrMag/amazon-bedrock)\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish\n\n[qpdv](https://repost.aws/community/users/USd4EprWjdS4qPfYyYD6UJDw)\n\naskeda year ago3.8K views\n\n5 Answers\n\n- Newest\n- Most votes\n- Most comments\n\n2\n\nAccepted Answer\n\nHello!\n\nI send you the below rePost question previously answered for similar error regarding ThrottlingException, is for Claude v2.1 but it applies in the same way to Claude v3:\n\n- [https://repost.aws/questions/QU11DRlMZfRDy0ngHxpO1VCw/throttlingexceptions-while-using-on-demand-bedrock-runtime-for-invoking-claude-v2-1](https://repost.aws/questions/QU11DRlMZfRDy0ngHxpO1VCw/throttlingexceptions-while-using-on-demand-bedrock-runtime-for-invoking-claude-v2-1)\n\nHere one of the possible solutions to this problem, provisioned throughput provides reserved capacity for your account specifically:\n\n- [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prov-throughput.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prov-throughput.html)\n\nCommentShare\n\n![profile picture](https://repost.aws/media/profilePicture/thumbnails/small/IMKJvgoJ1QSX20eEGuKGV3iA)![AWS](https://repost.aws/static/icons/common/icon_generic.svg)\n\n[igsalvar](https://repost.aws/community/users/USsW2eNZ_WQFCrjYKsTsq_gw)\n\nanswereda year ago\n\n![profile picture](https://repost.aws/media/profilePicture/thumbnails/small/IMzdmT0WRoRpOSrsKFEUoFHw)\n\nEXPERT\n\n[Oleksii Bebych](https://repost.aws/community/users/USyYP5VPAQSSy-rWgsNiZjCw)\n\nreviewed10 months ago\n\n- [qpdv](https://repost.aws/community/users/USd4EprWjdS4qPfYyYD6UJDw)\na year ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello. Specifically my question was when will this rate limit be removed or reset?\nAs of now, it has been 18 hours and I am still receiving this rate limit/throttling error..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Share\n\n- [taylort](https://repost.aws/community/users/USFAs6-8JuQgy7SM6S4Jwvsg)\n6 months ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is very difficult to work with, and still an issue despite \"The internal Bedrock team is working on expand capacity and address this issue\"\n\n\n\nI'm barely using it - sometimes 2-3 requests within a minute will trigger this issue and fail. I'm not doing anything unusual / tricky - just calling these from Step Functions using the built-in Bedrock stages.\n\n\n\nThere must be a better option for Bedrock to scale up beyond 2-3 requests in a minute than having to purchase dedicated throughput? It's difficult to assess what the backoff algorithm should be, or which region to switch to, since there's almost no clarity on when this severe throttling will occur.\n\n\n\nAWS must be able to scale better than this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Share\n\n2\n\nI'm also getting the ThrottlingException when trying to use Claude 3 Opus, regardless of when and how many times I try. Do I need to change some hidden configuration? Is this a known problem?\nThank you.\n\nCommentShare\n\n[Douglas](https://repost.aws/community/users/USAWdt8-wqQEmpe7Wg2Mtizg)\n\nanswered10 months ago\n\n1\n\nHi,\n\nAs you are using an **on-demand model** that makes use of a shared capacity pool, during periods of high demand across the service your account may be throttled below their expected rates.\n\nThe internal Bedrock team is working on expand capacity and address this issue, but currently we don't have an ETA in place for capacity increases.\n\nMeanwhile you can try changing the model or the region if your use case allows it, or purchasing the provisioned throughput (see the upper link) to have allocated capacity to your account.\n\nCommentShare\n\n![profile picture](https://repost.aws/media/profilePicture/thumbnails/small/IMKJvgoJ1QSX20eEGuKGV3iA)![AWS](https://repost.aws/static/icons/common/icon_generic.svg)\n\n[igsalvar](https://repost.aws/community/users/USsW2eNZ_WQFCrjYKsTsq_gw)\n\nanswereda year ago\n\n0\n\nI'm having the same problem.

I have tried various regions and models; every single one fails. I'm trying via API and from a lambda function and with a simple example from the AWS documentation. What is the secret to get this to work ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Share\n\n0\n\nI manage two AWS accounts. One has premium support. More on that in a moment.\n\nA problem is caused by AWS throttling their claimed default quota value for **On-demand InvokeModel requests per minute for Anthropic Claude 3 Opus**. Their published default quota value is 50. In both my accounts they throttled it down to 1 request per minute. This caused errors whenever a Claude 3 Opus agent triggered more than 1 Bedrock Builder Tools action group lambda function during a single interaction.\n\nThe problem was solved in about 3 days in my account with the premium support - they were slow, but they didn't quibble over setting my account to the default quota value of 50.\nDifferent story for my account without premium support. It's now day 5 of arguing with AWS billing support over their failure to supply the default quota value. They're asking ridiculous questions, wasting my time, being deliberately obstructive after I already justified my use cases.\nI've been using AWS since it was a beta service, before it even had a control panel. I'm disappointed in how AWS can no longer be trusted to be transparent and honest in their policies & pricing.\n\nCommentShare\n\n[Rob](https://repost.aws/community/users/USV2Fgeci6TFa_ilHdWdBZbg)\n\nanswereda month ago\n\nAdd your answer\n\nYou are not logged in.

quotas\n\n[PDF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/general/latest/gr/aws-general.pdf#bedrock)\n\nTo connect programmatically to an AWS service, you use an endpoint. AWS services offer the following endpoint types\nin some or all of the AWS Regions that the service supports: IPv4 endpoints, dual-stack endpoints, and FIPS endpoints.\nSome services provide global endpoints. For more information, see [AWS service endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html).\n\nService quotas, also referred to as limits, are the maximum number of service resources or operations for your AWS account.\nFor more information, see [AWS service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html).\n\nThe following are the service endpoints and service quotas for this service.\n\n## Amazon Bedrock service endpoints\n\n### Amazon Bedrock control plane APIs\n\nThe following table provides a list of Region-specific endpoints that Amazon Bedrock supports for\nmanaging, training, and deploying models.

Contact your AWS account manager to be considered for an increase. Due to overwhelming demand, priority will be given to customers who generate traffic that consumes their existing quota allocation. Your request might be denied if you don't meet this condition.\n\n\nTo view service quotas for Amazon Bedrock in a console interface, follow the steps at [Viewing service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/gs-request-quota.html) and select **Amazon Bedrock** as the service.

Anthropic Claude Usage Tiers Using Bedrocklg.../\n\n# Anthropic Claude Usage Tiers Using Bedrock\n\n0\n\nWe've been using Claude 3 Sonnet for months via Bedrock and switched to Claude 3.5 Sonnet and now we are experiencing rate limit HTTP 429 errors from the Bedrock API (too many requests) that we never experienced with Claude 3 (see Anthropic rate limits at [https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/rate-limits](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/rate-limits)). How do we know what usage tier we are on Anthropic if we are a Bedrock user? And does you usage tier get reset when you change to a new model?

And it seems you cannot request an increase. That's unfortunate.\n\n[https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/bedrock/quotas](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/bedrock/quotas)\n\nCommentShare\n\n[DJL](https://repost.aws/community/users/US3_nw6TzrSves0p8Z8yKltA)\n\nanswered8 months agolg...\n\n![profile picture](https://repost.aws/media/profilePicture/thumbnails/small/IMzdmT0WRoRpOSrsKFEUoFHw)\n\nEXPERT\n\n[Oleksii Bebych](https://repost.aws/community/users/USyYP5VPAQSSy-rWgsNiZjCw)\n\nreviewed8 months agolg...\n\n![profile picture](https://repost.aws/media/profilePicture/thumbnails/small/IMuhQWvwMXSdCdMqLwPrwFgw)![AWS](https://repost.aws/static/icons/common/aws_logo_rgb_white.svg)\n\nEXPERT\n\n[Didier\\_Durand](https://repost.aws/community/users/US9EmCAaadQL6tAn_w_Q877w)\n\nreviewed8 months agolg...\n\n- [Didier\\_Durand](https://repost.aws/community/users/US9EmCAaadQL6tAn_w_Q877w) EXPERT\n8 months ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi, agreed: we also experience lower quotas for Sonnet v3.5 when compared to v3. And you cannot upgrade for now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Share\n\n0\n\nPlease work with your TAM or SA or AM to do an internal quota increase request. The quotas for the bedrock models have a different increase approval process internally.
