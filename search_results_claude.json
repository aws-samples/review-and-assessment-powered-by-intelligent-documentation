I'm not doing anything unusual / tricky - just calling these from Step Functions using the built-in Bedrock stages.\n\n\n\nThere must be a better option for Bedrock to scale up beyond 2-3 requests in a minute than having to purchase dedicated throughput? It's difficult to assess what the backoff algorithm should be, or which region to switch to, since there's almost no clarity on when this severe throttling will occur.\n\n\n\nAWS must be able to scale better than this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Share\n\n2\n\nI'm also getting the ThrottlingException when trying to use Claude 3 Opus, regardless of when and how many times I try.

I have tried various regions and models; every single one fails. I'm trying via API and from a lambda function and with a simple example from the AWS documentation. What is the secret to get this to work ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Share\n\n0\n\nI manage two AWS accounts. One has premium support. More on that in a moment.\n\nA problem is caused by AWS throttling their claimed default quota value for **On-demand InvokeModel requests per minute for Anthropic Claude 3 Opus**. Their published default quota value is 50. In both my accounts they throttled it down to 1 request per minute. This caused errors whenever a Claude 3 Opus agent triggered more than 1 Bedrock Builder Tools action group lambda function during a single interaction.\n\nThe problem was solved in about 3 days in my account with the premium support - they were slow, but they didn't quibble over setting my account to the default quota value of 50.\nDifferent story for my account without premium support. It's now day 5 of arguing with AWS billing support over their failure to supply the default quota value. They're asking ridiculous questions, wasting my time, being deliberately obstructive after I already justified my use cases.\nI've been using AWS since it was a beta service, before it even had a control panel. I'm disappointed in how AWS can no longer be trusted to be transparent and honest in their policies & pricing.\n\nCommentShare\n\n[Rob](https://repost.aws/community/users/USV2Fgeci6TFa_ilHdWdBZbg)\n\nanswereda month ago\n\nAdd your answer\n\nYou are not logged in.

To view service quotas for Amazon Bedrock, do one of the following:\n\n- Follow the steps at [Viewing service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/gs-request-quota.html) and select **Amazon Bedrock** as the service.\n\n- Refer to the [Amazon Bedrock service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/bedrock.html#limits_bedrock) in the AWS General Reference.\n\n\nTo maintain the performance of the service and to ensure appropriate usage of Amazon Bedrock, the default quotas assigned to an account might be updated depending on regional factors, payment history, fraudulent usage, and/or approval of a quota increase request.\n\n## Request an increase for Amazon Bedrock quotas\n\nThe steps for requesting a quota increase for your account depend on the value in the **Adjustable** column in the quotas table in [Amazon Bedrock service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/bedrock.html#limits_bedrock):\n\n- If a quota is marked as **Yes**, you can adjust it by following the steps at [Requesting a Quota\\\\\nIncrease](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html) in the Service Quotas User Guide.\n\n- If a quota is marked as **No**, you can submit a request through the [limit increase form](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase) to be considered for an increase.\n\n- The **On-demand model invocation** quotas aren't adjustable through Service Quotas. Contact your AWS account manager to be considered for an increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n###### Note\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to overwhelming demand, priority will be given to customers who generate traffic that consumes their existing quota allocation. Your request might be denied if you don't meet this condition.\n\n\n[Document Conventions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/docconventions.html)\n\nTroubleshooting Amazon Bedrock API Error Codes\n\nDocument history\n\nDid this page help you? - Yes\n\nThanks for letting us know we're doing a good job!\n\nIf you've got a moment, please tell us what we did right so we can do more of it.\n\nDid this page help you? - No\n\nThanks for letting us know this page needs work.
